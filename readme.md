# `@timsuchanek/auto`

Helps you automate setting up projects.

## Projects

### Prisma

Includes the latest Prisma Client alpha with a running SQLite example.
I'm using this myself a lot, to quickly get reproductions running.

This is not an official Prisma tool!

## Usage

```bash
mkdir test
cd test
npx @timsuchanek/auto prisma
ts-node main.ts
```
